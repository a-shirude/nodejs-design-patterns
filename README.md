**Creational design patterns**
* Singleton pattern
> "Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it"
* Prototype pattern 
> "Specify the kinds of objects to create using prototypical  instance and create new objects by copying this prototype."
* Factory pattern  
> "Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses."
* Builder pattern 
> "Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations."
